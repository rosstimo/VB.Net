'<Remarks>
'The FileOpen() functions allows for various file read/write options.
'FreeFile() returns the next available file number. It is used to refer to
'the to the file by the FileOpen function. File IO can throw a variety of 
'exceptions so Try/Catch Is used. Open file for input or read mode and 
'assigned a file number. Loop through all the records/lines until end of
'file or EOF().Input reads each record from File into currentRecord. The
'currentRecord is then added to the list box. Always close the file to
'avoid file In use IOException. Note: large files can be cumbersome when 
'the whole thing Is read into RAM. Options? Check target file size 
'attribute prior to read all and/or read one line at a time. Newer.NET
'file IO classes offer more efficient and elegant solutions.
